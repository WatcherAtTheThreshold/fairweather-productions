# Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Infrastructure & Main Site ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE
- [x] Create new repo: `fairweather-productions`
- [x] Set up basic folder structure 
- [x] Migrate Fairweather Studios to root level
- [x] Copy Sketchy Ponderings to `/sketchy-ponderings/` folder ✅ WORKING
- [ ] Copy The Second Gaze to `/second-gaze/` folder (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Test basic GitHub Pages deployment at `watcheratthethreshold.github.io/fairweather-productions`
- [ ] Add CNAME file (after testing)
- [ ] SquareSpace DNS setup (after testing)

## Phase 2: Testing & Cross-Site Links
- [ ] Test all three sites work at GitHub URL
- [ ] Update cross-site links in Fairweather Studios
- [ ] Update cross-site links in The Second Gaze  
- [ ] Test cross-site navigation

## Phase 3: Domain Migration
- [ ] Set up SquareSpace DNS records
- [ ] Add CNAME file with `fairweatherproductions.com`
- [ ] Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)
- [ ] Test all sites at new domain

## Backup Strategy ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Original repos remain as full backups:
  - `sketchy-ponderings` repo
  - `the-second-gaze` repo  
  - Previous Fairweather Studios files

## Test URLs
- **GitHub Pages**: `watcheratthethreshold.github.io/fairweather-productions/`
- **Sketchy Ponderings**: `watcheratthethreshold.github.io/fairweather-productions/sketchy-ponderings/`
- **Second Gaze**: `watcheratthethreshold.github.io/fairweather-productions/second-gaze/`
- **Final Domain**: `fairweatherproductions.com`

## Next Session Goals
1. Enable GitHub Pages and test at GitHub URL
2. If testing successful, proceed with SquareSpace DNS setup
3. Update cross-site links once domain is working

## Issues Encountered
- **GitHub subdirectory creation**: GitHub web interface wouldn't allow direct folder upload. **Solution**: Create empty subdirectory online first, then upload all files and subfolders to it.
- **Sketchy Ponderings**: Successfully uploaded to `/sketchy-ponderings/` - all pages tested and working
